    "date": "2025-09-20",
    "content": "The GST Council has announced mandatory e-invoicing for all B2B transactions starting April 2026, aimed at enhancing transparency and reducing tax evasion. This applies to businesses with an annual turnover above â‚¹5 crore.\n\nE-invoicing requires generating invoices through the GST portal, which assigns a unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN). This streamlines input tax credit reconciliation and reduces manual errors. For detailed guidelines, visit [GST Portal](https://www.gst.gov.in).\n\nBusinesses must upgrade their accounting systems to integrate with the GST Network API. Small businesses may face challenges in compliance due to technology costs. Our team at Jayadeva & Co. offers comprehensive support for system integration.\n\nWe recommend starting the transition early to avoid penalties. Contact us to assess your readiness and implement e-invoicing solutions.\n\nThis mandate also aligns with global digital tax trends, positioning India as a leader in tax automation.",
